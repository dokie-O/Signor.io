# NOTE from front-end dev 
- I'm not sure if my code quality is fully back-end ready.
- The back-end code contains errors that I can't fix since it's written by a different developer.
- To run the project **without errors**, please delete the following files:
  - `go`
  - `login`
  - `register`
  
  These files include back-end logic that currently causes issues.

- For now, In order to access the **Student Dashboard**, go to:  
   `http://localhost:3000/studentDashboard`
